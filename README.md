# Verbasizer

A modern, browser-based reimagining of David Bowieâ€™s legendary **Verbasizer** â€” the text-cutting and remixing tool originally built in the 1990s to help spark creativity.  

This version runs entirely client-side: paste or upload text, route words into parts of speech, and instantly generate fresh cut-up lines or full text blocks. No ads, no logins, no server.

## ðŸŽ¶ Background

The cut-up method was pioneered in the 1950sâ€“60s by **William S. Burroughs**, who physically sliced and rearranged printed text to create unexpected juxtapositions.  

In the 1990s, **David Bowie** collaborated with programmer Ty Roberts to build the first digital *Verbasizer* for Macintosh. Bowie used it extensively to generate lyric fragments and break creative blocks.  

This project updates the idea for the web â€” accessible to anyone with a browser.
